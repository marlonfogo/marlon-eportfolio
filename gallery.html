                         <h2>EASTER ISLAND</h2>
                         <p>I chose to re-create one of my old designs based on the Easter Island moai statues. I taught myself how to use illustrator a few years ago when I wanted to start a t-shirt printing business. For this design, I started with an image of one of the statues and made an outline using the pen tool. I used the same tool for the other linework and shadows. </p>

                         <h2>#SELFIE</h2>
                         <p>This was more challenging than I anticipated as there are many things that can be considered defining characteristics about oneself. I went back and forth about which things mattered the most to me that would help to give the viewer a better idea of who I am without having to tell them with words. A litany of cars, clothes, plants, music, art and furniture were left on the cutting room floor for the sake of the final image, instead, I chose to highlight the few things that have been on my mind as of late. Art: represented by one of my favorite paintings “the Scream” by Edvard Munch, Clothes: represented by the mascot for the Japanese streetwear brand A Bathing Ape, and a depiction of my newfound affinity for boxy cars from the 80s and 90s. I couldn’t decide between the two, so I chose both the Fiat 131 and Lancia Delta Integrale.</p>

                         <h2>CHINFACE</h2>
                         <p>When I first attempted this assignment, I had no idea what I wanted the GIF to be. For some reason when I tried to think of something funny, the first thing I could think of was a chin face. Typically, when I can’t think of ideas for something creative lean on clichés to get started. With the chin face in mind, what I came up with was a GIF to make the reader smile.</p>

                         <h2>HOME ALONE</h2>
                         <p>I’ve been living on my own for a little over a year now. This probably would be ideal in a pre-pandemic NYC but we no longer live in that world. I spend a lot of my time at home, working and learning, so I was inspired to create an audio story of the good feeling I used to have, coming home to an apartment free of roommates. I recorded the moment on my laptop using my apartment other electronics for atmosphere. I didn’t record everything in one take so getting the volume for each recording level took some work, and it’s still not perfect.</p>
