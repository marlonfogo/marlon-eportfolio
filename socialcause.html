                    <h1>THINK AND DRIVE</h1>
                    <p>I chose to do my final project in our multimedia class on driving under the influence. Though Iâ€™m fortunate enough to not have had anyone in my life be harmed by such behavior, I believe it is a far too common practice. This has been a cause that people have been campaigning against for decades. Organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Responsibility.org have dedicated their mission to educating drivers on the danfers of driving while uder the influence of drugs and alcohol.

                    I decided to pull inspiration from our selfie project, using one of the cars featured in the image as the vehicle in my PSA-style animation. The scene depicts a car in a parking lot after a party lets out. Friends sit in the car and just before they pull off one asks the driver if they're okay to drive. We don't hear an answer but what follows the heavy consequence of not thinking before you drive.</p>
